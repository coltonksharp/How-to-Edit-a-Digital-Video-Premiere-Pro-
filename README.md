Premiere Pro is accessible today with Adobe's new CC line of applications. CC stands for Creative Cloud. Applications under Creative Cloud can now be downloaded and accessed from the Adobe CC Launcher

## CC (Adobe Creative Cloud) Download
Download Adobe Creative Cloud (https://creativecloud.adobe.com/apps/download/creative-cloud)

Note: To use Adobe CC, you must create or use an existing account. Account creation will not be covered in this tutorial. Follow the login path on Adobe's website and utilize online tools like YouTube if necessary. Apps will also require a subscription service to be accessed. Check to see if Adobe offers any demos. If you are a university student, Adobe offers a great student plan that can significantly save money on your subscriptions. 

## Premiere Pro Download

After launching and signing into the application, you will see a tab bar on the left, tab content in the middle, and tab/profile detail on the right depending on which tab has been selected.

To DOWNLOAD Premiere Pro:

1. Click on 'Apps' in the tab bar on the right
2. Scroll to find 'Premier Pro'
3. Click 'install' in the Premier Pro

The application will either ask for a download location or begin to install automatically. Once finished open the application. 

# Step 2: Launch and Project Setup

After launching the application the first thing you will see is your Project Manager. Here you can create or open previous projects you have worked on. 

On the left side of the screen, you will see two buttons:

NEW PROJECT and OPEN PROJECT

** Click NEW PROJECT **

A new window will pop up asking for the project name, location, and template.

Give your project a name and download location.

Ignore templates for now. On WINDOWS you will see Import settings on the right and media in the center. IGNORE. These are not important at the moment and are something to look into the more you edit in the future.

UNLESS you don't have footage. If you don't have footage that's okay. Simply check the boxes on 2-3 videos that adobe provides and they will be imported into your project.

** Click 'CREATE' in the bottom right corner after editing. **
