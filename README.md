# How to Edit a Digital Video (Premiere Pro)
## Written by Colton Sharp

The purpose of this tutorial is to introduce an easy step-by-step guide to editing a digital video you have captured on your phone/camera. This is a beginner-level tutorial covering concepts that include setting up your project, sequence settings, managing your footage, timeline basics, rendering, and finally exporting your video. This tutorial will not cover advanced concepts like effects, effect controls, sound design, etc. This tutorial is open to anyone looking to get started in Adobe: Premiere Pro or anyone who wants to pursue a career in film or video editing. 

# Step 1: Download Premiere Pro 

* If you already have the application istalled skip to Step 2! *

Premiere Pro is accessible today with Adobe's new CC line of applications. CC stands for Creative Cloud. Applications under Creative Cloud can now be downloaded and accessed from the Adobe CC Launcher

## CC (Adobe Creative Cloud) Download
Download Adobe Creative Cloud (https://creativecloud.adobe.com/apps/download/creative-cloud)

Note: To use Adobe CC, you must create or use an existing account. Account creation will not be covered in this tutorial. Follow the login path on Adobe's website and utilize online tools like YouTube if necessary. Apps will also require a subscription service to be accessed. Check to see if Adobe offers any demos. If you are a university student, Adobe offers a great student plan that can significantly save money on your subscriptions. 

## Premiere Pro Download

After launching and signing into the application, you will see a tab bar on the left, tab content in the middle, and tab/profile detail on the right depending on which tab has been selected.

To DOWNLOAD Premiere Pro:

1. Click on 'Apps' in the tab bar on the right
2. Scroll to find 'Premier Pro'
3. Click 'install' in the Premier Pro

The application will either ask for a download location or begin to install automatically. Once finished open the application. 

# Step 2: Launch and Project Setup

After launching the application the first thing you will see is your Project Manager. Here you can create or open previous projects you have worked on. 

On the left side of the screen, you will see two buttons:

NEW PROJECT and OPEN PROJECT

### Click 'NEW PROJECT'

A new window will pop up asking for the project name, location, and template.

Give your project a name and download location.

Ignore templates for now. On WINDOWS you will see Import settings on the right and media in the center. IGNORE. These are not important at the moment and are something to look into the more you edit in the future.

UNLESS you don't have footage. If you don't have footage that's okay. Simply check the boxes on 2-3 videos that adobe provides and they will be imported into your project.

### Click 'CREATE' in the bottom right corner.

Review: 
1. Click 'NEW PROJECT'
2. Give the project a name
3. Select the project location
4. Import Adobe's footage (optional)
5. Click 'Create'

# Step 3: Workspace

When your project opens it will open up the editing tab by default. On this tab there will be several windows called "Workspaces". 

### This will be overwelming at first but have trust in me and don't touch anything!

The defualt window is divided into FOUR workspaces. 

Top left: Effect Controls (Click on 'Effect Controls' in the box if not opened by default)
Top Right: Program Monitor 
Bottom Left: Project Panel 
Bottom Right: Timeline

I will not go over every workspace. Workspaces can be added and removed. For now it's best to not make any changes.

* The EFFECT CONTROLS panel is where you can manipluate effects for your selected video file in the timeline

* The PROGRAM MONITOR is how you review your project(video) during the editing process

* The PROJECT PANEL is where you can manage project files or detials

* The TIMELINE is where you can add and manipulate footage

### For this tutorial we will focus mainly on the PROJECT PANEL and TIMELINE 

# Step 4: Importing Video File(s)

For this step we will look at the PROJECT PANEL in the bottom left of the screen.

Located in the center you will see a big blue button that reads: "Import media" 

### Click 'Import Media'

Your file manager will now open. 

### Select 2-3 video files to import into the project.

After importing, your footage will now be in the workspace. 

### To import more footage: Right-click and select 'Import...' 

Note: If you do not have footage and used Adobe's footage you will not see the import button. The footage will already be in the workspace.

Review:
1. Travel to your Project Panel in the bottom left box of the application
2. Click 'Import media'
3. Select 2-3 video files from your project manager

# Step 5: Timeline Setup 

Now if we look to the bottom right in the TIMELINE box you will see it's empty.

### We need to create a sequence to start editing our footage!

Real quick, I want to show you how to make a custom sequence in the timeline. Go back to the Project Panel and on the bottom left of the box; click on what looks like a sticky note. A list will pop up and at the top will be 'sequence'. Click 'sequence'.

Here you can create a sequence with your desired preset, settings, etc. HOWEVER, this is advanced! You will learn how to utilize this later.

### Instead

We are going to close this window. From your PROJECT PANEL; click and drag a video file that you imported into the TIMELINE box on the bottom right. You will see your timeline now fill with tracks and the video file will now be in video/audio tracks: V1 and A2.

### This is very useful because...

When you drag and drop, Adobe will autoatically create and adjust your timeline based on your footage. You won't have to worry about "finding the right settings" at this moment. Custom timelines are important for advanced users when multiple cameras or sequences are used in a single project. 

Review:
1. Go to the Project Panel on the bottom left. 
2. Click and drag a video file from the Project Panel to the Timeline workspace.
